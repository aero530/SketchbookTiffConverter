version: "1.0"

about: This is a command line program that will convert a single tiff file or directory of tiff files that were created using Autodesk Sketchbook and convert them to Open Raster images (ora) so they can be opened / modified using other software (such as Gimp or Krita).
args:
    - path:
        short: p
        long: path
        help: Path of the tiff file or directory of tiff files to convert
        takes_value: true
        required: true
    - layer:
        short: l
        long: layer
        help: Exports layers of each file processed as tiff files in addition to exporting the ora file (helpful if a file doesn't convert correctly for some reason). Note that these are the raw tiff layers as stored by Sketchbook so they are flipped vertically, in BGRA (instead of standard RGBA), & the rgb values are premultiplied by the alpha channel value.
        required: false
    - verbose:
        short: v
        help: Sets the level of verbosity (v, vv, vvv).  Increasing the number of v's is helpful for debug if a file doesn't convert correctly.
        multiple: true
        required: false
